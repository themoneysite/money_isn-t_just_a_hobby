   <p>Do you understand the true power of analysing? Do you have that one friend that always seems to spot
     things which you find impossible? Do you ever play games against that one friend and he always seems to understand
      the game and quickly create a strategy? My friend is someone who understands the true power of analysing. I'm Guessing you 
      want to know how to do this yourself:</p>
   <p>First understand that whatever you're doing, even if it is trying to understand why some people are successful, you need to understand 
    the game. Here’s an example, you want to learn how to become more confident, how to be more comfortable around people. The first thing you
     have to do is gain the needed knowledge, if it is reading books about psychology, or watching videos, just learn and understand the basics.</p>
   <p>So you’ve learned the basics, what’s the next step? Try implementing those basics into your life, experiment, see what works, try to understand
     what you're looking at and understand your surroundings. If you previously struggled becoming more social and confident, use the basics that you’v
      learned and try approaching people without making it awkward, now how do you do that? Try listening to what their talking abou, and if you understand 
      what their talking about approach them when the time is right.”I love cars those engines go crazy have you seen the new engines in the hybrid vehicles”, 
      “Hey I heard you guys were talking about hybrid cars, my dad works with a car company where they produce hybrid cars”. Notice how you just joined at the 
      right time, you positioned the conversation to a much more interesting subject but you also referred to their interest. This is also why general knowledge
       is important, it will make it much easier to join multiple conversations. 
</p>
   <p>You are at the school prom and you see there is a group of teenagers that you want to approach so how do you do it without making anything awkward. First make
     yourself look strong and confident, if you look scared people will notice and some people are assholes so they’ll try and make fun of you so let your body language
      tell the people you're fearless and confident, then greet them nicely. If someone else talks, listen to them and try to understand the situation they're talking about
       and don’t interfere to understand what's going on. It will sometimes make you seem like a fool and give them time to speak. Only try talking when they talk to you or
        if you can truly relate to other people in the group that will give you a great position.</p>
   <p>Once you become better at joining conversations, understand the role you want to take, do you want to be a listener, do you want to be a leader, or a moron. Understand when
     you talk to people above you like for instance business people, understand who is more important in the situation, ask  them questions about them and listen to them, talk leser about yourself.

    Understand your role in the game,  create a strategy, analyse it, look for opportunity and engage when it’s right.
    </p>
   <p>Apply this to business and you’ll  come far in life.</p>
