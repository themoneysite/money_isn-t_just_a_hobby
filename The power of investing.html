   <p>Have you read the previous page which spoke about the true value
     of money? If you remember, I spoke about how money is an illusion? Here’s where investing becomes key:</p>
   <p>What do all wealthy people have in common, they own things. Those things aren’t liabilities , those are assets. 
    Assets are what brings you money. You know how you exchange money for whatever it is you buy in stores like chocolates,
     well in the same way you trade for that you can trade your money for stocks, real estate, and other investments.
</p>
   <p>Many people think investing is very risky, as if you are putting money on thin ice and just waiting for the ice to break.
     If that is what you think about investing you are both right and wrong. See investing is the game of how you use your money,
      if you invest in something without the proper knowledge and without knowing what you’re doing, that is not investing that is gambling.
       Look at investing from this perspective:</p>
   <p>I think it was back in 2016 or 2018 where sony released  a playstaytion classic, it was a renewed version of the first playstation,
     except it had 10 in-build games, and people were complaining about it alot, but I did my research and I understood that this was more a
      collectors item than a product so I bought it for 50$ dollars. 2 or 3 Years later they aren’t really instock and those which are in-stock 
      cost almost 100$, that’s an investment. 
    If you do real estate, don’t just buy a house because it’s cheap, understand the surroundings and the purpose of the building, and its location.
     DO THE PROPER RESEARCH BEFORE INVESTING. 
    </p>
   <p>Still not convinced why you should invest, remember that paper bill in your wallet that is 20$, that money you saved. Saving your money isn’t
     going to save it, why? Inflation. Exchange the illusion for an asset or investment because that will save your money, and make the money work 
     for you only if you did your research.</p>
     <p>Do the research to find out what would make your money work the best for you and grow.
