    <h><b><i>The true value of money</i></b></h>

    <p>Well to some people money means everything. Many people don't even know how to work with money. 
        What truly is the purpose of money? Why are some people extremely rich and others extremely poor? Hereâ€™s the thing,:</p>
        <br></br>
    <p>About 3000 years ago people traded with cows and other animals, they only traded if they felt like it was worth trading, 
        for instance some countries valued cows higher than others because cows produce milk and could also be eaten so their value 
        was higher. Did you know there was a time in history when salt had higher value than gold? So trading was popular and people 
        only did it if it was fair. Later people started producing coins from gold, metal, aluminium and whatever they thought was valuable enough
         to form into coins. This system allowed people to give their assets a value tag for example 1 cow = 6 gold coins.They gave their assets a 
         value tag according to the value that it gave them. People wouldn't trade if it wasn't fair, and of course people did scam each other and 
         also had a lot of debt. Kings also later realised the more coins they have the more value their gold and the stronger their empire could 
         become, so they usually had a lot of animals that they sold for coins, and with those coins they usually bought gold items to fulfil their
          dreams, the more wise kings bought more land and assets with their coins. </p>
    <p>Later coins became too heavy and people built a bank which became popular amongst them.. Now people could store their money in the bank,and 
        that allowed them to keep  their coins there. Fast forward in time, banks realised coins became too expensive so they decided to create coins 
        from cheaper materials, and the picture on the coins was what determined the coins value, this is when money became an illusion, the money was 
        the same material but only the picture made some of the coins more valuable than others. Then paper money came into the market, why paper money? 
        It's not expensive to make because the Federal Reserve prints it. Paper money doesn't hold any value, to us a 
        a $200 note is worth 200 dollars, but it only costs 0.25c to print. Isn't your mind blown. Paper money doesn't hold any value it just shows you have
         that amount of money, how were humans tricked to value something worth 0.25c for 200$. We have come to the conclusion that money is one of man's biggest illusions. 
        </p>
    <p>So why are some people rich and some people poor? Well rich people understand this concept that money is only an illusion, and therefore they buy assets that could
         later hold more value, and they could make profit from it. Why is saving your money not the smartest move and why invest it? Have you ever heard of inflation? Did you
          know that America printed 80% of their money in the last 2 to 3 years? Why is inflation such a big problem?</p>
    <p>Let me put it this way, "The lesser there is of something,the more value it holds.The more there is of something, the lesser value it holds". So if you have lesser dollars
         it's worth more, if you print more it tends to lose its value. Well why invest? Do you remember when I spoke about the kings that bought land? If you bought land and started
          building houses there and other people also want to build houses there, your land will most likely triple in price. Why don't some products succeed? What value does it hold
           in the market? Do you remember when I talked about the cows that were traded only when they thought it was worth trading? Well keep it in mind that if you want to sell something,all 
           you have to do is analyse the market then determine its value. Money is a game and the more you play, the more knowledge you gain.</p>
